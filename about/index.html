			<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>
		Software Architect with around 15 years of experience transforming complex business problems into elegant technical solutions. I specialize in Domain-Driven Design, DSL development, and research-driven innovation across IoT, ML/AI, and automation domains.
I approach software through a unique lens—influenced by philosophical principles of simplicity and truth. Programming, for me, is creative expression. I read code like stories and design systems with logic. My expertise isn't about mastering languages; it's about understanding problems deeply and crafting solutions that serve the eventual end-users.
My work is rooted in systems thinking that extends beyond code. I consider organizational design, team dynamics, and behavioral psychology in architectural decisions. I believe in simplicity over complexity, collaboration over competition, and creative problem-solving over rigid frameworks.
I've worked across Consumer Goods, Ecommerce, Manufacturing, Telecom, and QA automation domains, earning recognition for innovative proof-of-concepts and mentorship in software craftsmanship. My technical specializations include:
			<br/>
•	Domain-Driven Design & Software Architecture <br/>
•	DSL Development <br/>
•	ML/AI Integration <br/>
•	IoT Development & Automation <br/>
•	Systems Design <br/>
Throughout my career, I've designed software systems, trained development teams, established intern training programs, and built solutions that prioritize sustainability and maintainability. I've been recognized for "making a difference" through superior technical ability, ownership, and teamwork.
Now stepping into independent work, I'm seeking collaborations where creativity meets purpose. I'm available for: <br/>
•	Consulting & Fractional CTO roles <br/>
•	Technical Advisory for early-stage startups <br/>
•	Architecture design & system refactoring <br/>
•	Research & Innovation partnerships <br/>
•	Mentorship & Training programs <br/>
I believe in slow, deliberate craftsmanship. Simple solutions over needless complexity. Collaboration that elevates everyone involved. If this resonates with your vision, let's talk.
When not architecting systems, I write, mentor emerging developers, explore the intersection of philosophy and technology, and work on building a computing society for collaborative learning.
