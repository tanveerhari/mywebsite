			<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>
		Hi! I am Tanveer Singh, a programmer based in India. My professional career has dawned since 2010, with my current role being as a Software Architect at QASource. Although most of my work has been in and around Java, my dabbling also include Python and xText. 

Outside of work, I like to express my thoughts through code and writings. I find solace in reading, listening (audiobooks and podcasts), taking long walks, and at times doing nothing.
